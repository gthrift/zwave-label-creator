## Device Database Format

When adding devices to `devices.json`:

```json
{
  "manufacturerId": "0x0086",        // 4-digit hex with 0x prefix
  "manufacturer": "AEON Labs",       // Official manufacturer name
  "devices": [
    {
      "productType": "0x0003",       // 4-digit hex with 0x prefix
      "productId": "0x0084",         // 4-digit hex with 0x prefix
      "label": "ZW096",              // Device model/label
      "description": "Smart Switch 6" // Short description
    }
  ]
}
```

**Tips:**
- Use official manufacturer names
- Include model numbers in labels
- Keep descriptions concise
- Verify hex IDs are lowercase
- Pad hex values to 4 digits
